# Python Project: Comparing Stock Prices

## Description
Write a program that compares the stock prices of APPLE, GOOGLE, MICROSOFT, and AMAZON. The program should retrieve the current stock prices of each company and calculate the percentage change in stock prices over a specified period.
The program should display the percentage change in stock prices for each company and identify which company's stocks are performing the best.
Additionally, the program should retrieve historical stock prices for each company and analyze any trends or patterns in the data.

### Note
Use the `pandas_datareader` library to load the dataset of the given companies.

## Code Structure
- **Importing Libraries**: Import necessary libraries for data retrieval and date handling.
- **Company Dictionary**: Create a dictionary to store company names and their stock symbols.
- **Date Range**: Define the start and end dates for retrieving historical stock data.
- **Retrieve Data**: Fetch stock data for each company using the `pandas_datareader`.
- **Calculate Percentage Change**: Compute the percentage change in stock prices for each company.
- **Display Results**: Print the percentage changes and identify the best performer.
- **Analyze Trends**: Display historical stock prices to identify any trends or patterns.

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas_datareader.data as web
from datetime import datetime

companies = {  # Creating a dictionary
    'Apple': 'AAPL',
    'Google': 'GOOGL',
    'Microsoft': 'MSFT',
    'Amazon': 'AMZN'
}

start_date = datetime(2023, 1, 1)  # setting the start date to January 1, 2023.
end_date = datetime(2023, 12, 31)  # setting the end date to December 31, 2023.

stock_data = {}  # Creating an empty dictionary

for company, symbol in companies.items():  # Unpacking each key-value pair into the variables company and symbol
    df = web.DataReader(symbol, 'stooq', start_date, end_date)  # retrieves stock data for a company(symbol) from
    # Stooq within a specified date range.
    stock_data[company] = df  # Assigning the retrieved stock data (df) to the stock_data dictionary using the
    # company name (company) as the key.
percentage_change = {}  # Let's define a new dictionary.

for company, data in stock_data.items():  # It iterates through key-value pairs in the stock_data dictionary. In
    # each iteration, company is assigned the key (company name) and data is
    # assigned the value (stock data).
    initial_price = data['Close'][0]  # Retrieves the first closing price from the Close column of the DataFrame.
    final_price = data['Close'][-1]  # Retrieves the last closing price from the Close column of the DataFrame.

    percentage_change[company] = ((final_price - initial_price) / initial_price) * 100  # This line calculates the
    # percentage change in a stock's
    # price and stored in the
    # 'percent_change dictionary'.

print("Percentage change in stock prices: ")  # Displaying percentage change for each company
for company, change in percentage_change.items():
    print(f"{company}: {change:.2f}% change.")

best_performer = max(percentage_change, key=percentage_change.get)  # Finding the company with the highest
# percentage change in stock price.
# 'key = percentage_change.get' tells 'max()' to use the values (percentage changes) to determine the maximum,
# rather than the keys (company names).

print(f"{percentage_change[best_performer]:.2f}% change.")

# Analyzing trends or patterns in the data:

for company, data in stock_data.items():
    print(f"\n Historical stock prices for {company}")
    print(data.head())  # Printing the first 5 rows of 'data'
```
