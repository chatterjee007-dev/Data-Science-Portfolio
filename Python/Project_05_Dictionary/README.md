# Python Project: Dictionary

## Project Overview
This project allows users to create a dictionary of personal details for multiple people. It prompts the user to input the name, age, and occupation of each person, stores this information in a dictionary, and then displays the details of all the people entered.

## Key Features
- Allows user to input the number of people.
- Collects name, age, and occupation for each person.
- Stores personal details in a dictionary.
- Displays the dictionary with all the details entered by the user.

## Libraries Used
- **None**: This project uses only built-in Python libraries.

## Code Explanation
The project performs the following steps:
1. **User Input**: The program asks the user to input the number of people whose details they want to add.
2. **Data Collection**: For each person, the program prompts for their name, age, and occupation.
3. **Dictionary Creation**: It stores the entered details in a dictionary, where each name is a key and their corresponding age and occupation are stored as values.
4. **Display**: Finally, it prints out the dictionary containing all entered details.

## Code Structure
- **Function Definition**: Defines a function `people_details()` to take user input and return a dictionary.
- **Dictionary Creation**: Inside the function, a dictionary `people_deets` is populated with user input.
- **Displaying Data**: The function returns the dictionary, and a loop prints each person's details.

## Code Snippet
```python
def people_details():
    num_people = int(input("How many people? "))  # Taking input of number of people
    people_deets = {}

    for i in range(num_people):  # If number of people is 4, then i = 0,1,2,3
        name = input(f"Enter name of person {i+1} : ")  # For i = 0, we will take input of the 1st person's details.
        age = input(f"Enter age of person {i+1} : ")
        occupation = input(f"Enter occupation of person {i+1} : ")

        people_deets[name] = {'Age': age, 'Occupation': occupation}  # Defining our dictionary
    return people_deets

details = people_details()  # Calling the function to get the dictionary

print("\nDetails of people : ")
for name, info in details.items():  # This line iterates through key-value pairs in the 'details' dictionary,
                                     # assigning the key to 'name' and the value to 'info'.
    print(f"Name : {name}, Age : {info['Age']}, Occupation : {info['Occupation']}")
```

## Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.  

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone this repository :
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chatterjee007-dev/Data-Science-Portfolio.git
2. Navigate to the project directory :
   ```bash
   cd Data-Science-Portfolio/Python/Project_05_Dictionary
3. Run the script :
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Dictionary.ipynb

## Sample Run
```python
How many people? 2
Enter name of person 1: John
Enter age of person 1: 30
Enter occupation of person 1: Engineer
Enter name of person 2: Sarah
Enter age of person 2: 25
Enter occupation of person 2: Teacher

Details of people: 
Name: John, Age: 30, Occupation: Engineer
Name: Sarah, Age: 25, Occupation: Teacher
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Expand Information**:
   - Add more fields such as address, phone number, and email to the personal details.

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Implement input validation to ensure the correct format of data (e.g., age as an integer).

3. **Search Functionality**:
   - Add a feature to search for a personâ€™s details by name.

4. **Persistent Storage**:
   - Save the dictionary to a file (e.g., CSV or JSON) and load it when the program starts.
